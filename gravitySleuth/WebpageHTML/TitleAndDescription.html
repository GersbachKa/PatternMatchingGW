<h3>Background</h3>
<p>When a gravitational wave detector such as LIGO or the future LISA detects gravitational waves, they&rsquo;re not detected as perfect curves as one might expect. Rather they are hidden in instrument noise generated by the detector itself, as well as background noise the detector picks up due to its extreme sensitivity. To pull gravitational wave signals from this noise there are teams of scientists and data analysts whose sole purpose is to create different methods of writing programs that can pull a gravitational wave signal out from raw detector data. The more automated the data analysis of the detector data is the more time scientists can spend working on other problems, which is why data analysis innovation is so important.</p>
<p>In this activity there are simulations of raw detector data that contain noise and a gravitational wave signal from a certain type of astrophysical phenomenon. Your job will be to best match the model gravitational wave signal with the curve from the noisy data. <strong>This simulates how data analysis retrieves the noiseless gravitational wave signal from the raw data</strong>. By moving the x axis slider for the burst waveform you can adjust where the model gravitational wave signal is on the graph, and by adjusting the difficulty level and your model waveform you can try to find the real gravitational wave signal. Once you have obtained a model gravitational wave signal that best represents the gravitational wave signal in the noisy data click &ldquo;test results&rdquo; to see what you scored! Your score reflects how well your model gravitational wave signal fits the actual gravitational wave signal within the data.</p>
<h3>The activity</h3>
<p>This activity contains examples of a few different types of waveform signals including noise, coalescence, monochromatic and burst signals. You are able to choose which waveform type best matches the unknown noisy waveform; which is given when you select the difficulty level and dataset.</p>
<p>The possible waveforms featured in this activity are:</p>
<p><strong>Noise -</strong> A noise &ldquo;wave&rdquo; is caused by the extreme sensitivity of the interferometer, causing it to detect terrestrial activity. These signals typically don&rsquo;t have any clear pattern and are aligned at zero on the y axis.<br /><strong>Coalescence -</strong> A coalescence waveform is caused by activity in a system that is rapidly changing or about to coalesce. A Blackhole Merger or an Extreme Mass Ratio Inspiral are examples of systems that give off coalescence waveforms.<br /><strong>Monochromatic -</strong> Monochromatic signals are from sources that continuously emit gravitational waves at a specific frequency. The term &ldquo;monochromatic&rdquo; refers to the fact that each wave has the same wavelength. An example of a monochromatic wave source is a Galactic Binary.<br /><strong>Burst -</strong> A burst signal is typically caused by a terrestrial interruption to the interferometer such as someone hitting one of the tubes. There is speculation that an event such as a supernova could cause a burst-like signal.</p>
