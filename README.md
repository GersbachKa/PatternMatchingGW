# PatternMatchingGW
A pattern matching interactive website used for gravitational wave outreach

Ensure you are in the PatternMatchingGW directory when you run the startBokeh.sh script file.
Alternatively, you can run the "bokeh serve gravitySleuth --show" to run it locally, or "bokeh serve gravitySleuth --allow-websocket-origin=\*" to host it as a server for others to connect.
